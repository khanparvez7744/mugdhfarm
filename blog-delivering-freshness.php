				<div class="">
					<p>We are all well aware of the fact that Agriculture, is the system that feeds our economy as well as our families. It not only affects our personal health but also has a great impact on the state of climate and the critical aspects of our day-to-day lives.</p>
					<p>In the present days, the need of organic and natural products has become remarkably high. Everyone wants to be delivered with the best quality food items, which eventually takes a lot of hard work and time for the farmers to get done with, but on the other hand when it comes to how much profit the farmers get, things get a little difficult on their part and our farmers face hurdles and threats that remain totally unheard. Specially the small farmers are vulnerable to unfair practices and other forms of abuse and many even are forced off of their land and others don’t even have the options for the processing and distribution of their products.</p>
					<p>Mugdh Farm was an initiative that came with a motive of uplifting the local farmers and bringing to you the best quality products. We believe that the farmers are our strength, as they work for the well-being of our cattle, work hard to grow fruits and vegetables without using any harmful chemicals, all this comes into hand just because of our farmers. Knowing the importance that Indian farmers hold, we believe they are to be equally treated with profits that are mostly taken by the large industries.</p>
                    <p>The distress among small farmers in India is market-driven to a large extent as small-scale farmers are disadvantaged by their week bargaining strength in the market. Most of the profit is disproportionately gained by the industrial-sized farms over smaller farms which ultimately benefits the large agricultural corporations more than the actual farmers that sell to them. With the aim of helping the local farmers across the region who face these kinds of hurdles, we have provided employment to the many small-scale farmers and rural poor into a collective to improve their bargaining strength in the market and we make sure to pay all our farmers with what they deserve.</p>
                    <p>At Mugdh we have an integrated farming system, which brings the goodness of fresh, hygienic fruits and vegetables that are safely delivered from the farms to your doorstep, at fair prices. Our farmers combine traditional farming methodology and modern technology structures to grow the best quality produce that promises taste and health in each bite and the use of cutting-edge technology ensures that you get super-nutritious, economically viable, fresh fruits, and vegetables that help build your immunity.</p>
                    <p>With a vision to become a firm that is committed to thoughtful & sustainable socio-economic development, we aim to become partners for progress with our family of farmers, customers, employees & associates. We will achieve this by growing fresh and safe food for our consumers through scientific & sustainable farming methodology, thereby improving farm income.</p>
                    <p>With the best-in-class supply chain model of delivering the fresh vegetables, fruits and dairy products, WE KEEP ON SUPPORTING FARMERS AND DELIVERING FRESHNESS AT YOUR DOORSTEP</p><br/>
