                    <p>There are several benefits to opt for fruits & vegetables online. So, let’s look at the key reasons that lead to buying them online.</p><br/>
                    <h6><b>Staying home at ease and ordering online is safe </b></h6>
                    <p>As we are going through a pandemic, it is very safe to order the vegetables and fruits online rather going out to the local market and then buy with the fear of getting infected. Staying at home is more beneficial as sitting on sofa, ordering and receiving it at the door is much better than going to the local market or vegetable/fruit seller and carrying the heavy products back home.</p><br/>
                    <h6><b>Saves Time</b></h6>
                    <p>Time is so important and we understand. Managing time for other trivial things becomes a burden, which is why shopping online seems like a more feasible option. All your orders can be placed just by a touch of your fingertips, the time required is extremely less as compared to the traditional method. Also, it can be considered super beneficial because it can save you precious time and you can shop 24×7 anytime. Therefore, buying fruits and vegetables online can be more beneficial and less time-consuming.</p><br/>
                    <h6><b>Saves you from the traffic panic</b></h6>
                    <p>Getting stuck in traffic gets quite annoying and the desire to shop gradually decreases.
                    With the ease of buying online from the comfort of your home becomes a better option than any other. In addition, pollution caused by traffic can contaminate food products, which does not happen in online purchases, since fruits and vegetables are well stored in the warehouse at low temperatures.</p><br/>
                    <h6><b>Multi Payment Options</b></h6>
                    <p>Let’s be honest, traditional shopping leaves you with a cash payment option most of the time with a lot of hassles. But when buying online, there are multiple options, such as online payment, card payment, and cash on delivery, which are more appropriate for the customer. Now online payments are made secure with no chances of information of the customers being passed here and there.</p><br/>
                    <h6><b>Proper Invoices</b></h6>
                    <p>In the case of going to the street vendors or the vegetable mandis , customers do not receive invoices for the products they buy. The great advantage of buying fruits and vegetables online is that you can manage your bills and expenses. You can print your invoice at any time. There is no chance of your invoices getting lost as they are available anytime in printable format.</p><br/>
                    <h6><b>No bargain hassles</b></h6>
                    <p>Shopping for food online allows you to buy fruits and vegetables at greatly reduced prices.
                    Various online retailers are making their way into the market and there is an aggressive price war among them. As a consumer, you would benefit from stiff competition, as most produce is fresh and readily available and, in most cases, cheaper than what your local street vendor would offer you.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h6><b>Different varieties at one go</b></h6>
                    <p>The world has become a smaller place with more trade between different countries. Browse the internet and you will find new fruits and vegetables that were unknown in the past but now they are reaching our homes.
                    Be it Chinese cabbage, Japanese squash, or yellow zucchini, it will be a shop for all of these in your home. Most of these imported items are not sold by fruit and vegetable vendors, as they are perceived as very expensive. All of these are rich in minerals and nutrients and promote the health of your family. You will easily find them in these online stores.
                    </p><br/>
